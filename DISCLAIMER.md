# Non-Affiliation Disclaimer

## Important Notice

This project is an **independent learning and portfolio demonstration**. It is:

- ✅ **NOT** affiliated with, endorsed by, or created at the request of any company
- ✅ **NOT** production-ready or a replacement for IBM Sterling B2B Integrator
- ✅ **NOT** commissioned work or consulting deliverables
- ✅ A **proof-of-concept** demonstrating learning capability and operating model thinking

## Purpose

This repository was created to demonstrate:

1. **Rapid Learning Capability**: How I approach learning new domains (EDI, Sterling patterns)
2. **Operating Model Thinking**: How I think about making EDI "boring and reliable"
3. **Technical Leadership**: Hands-on coding combined with strategic thinking
4. **Portfolio Artifact**: Concrete example of how I ramp on new technologies

## Scope Clarification

This is a **POC (Proof of Concept)** with tiered capabilities:

- **Tier 1**: Implemented for demo (X12 parsing, validation, metrics)
- **Tier 2**: Stubbed/illustrative patterns (Sterling API, Acumatica sync)
- **Tier 3**: Future/roadmap items (EDIFACT transformation, AI validation)

## Production Use

**This code is NOT production-ready.** In a real environment, I would:

- Leverage IBM Sterling B2B Integrator for production EDI processing
- Use established EDI providers for partner certifications
- Work with SMEs and vendors for proper mappings
- Follow enterprise-grade security and compliance practices
