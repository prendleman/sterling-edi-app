Subject: Thank You - EDI Application Portfolio Piece

Dear Bill,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Director of Information Technology position at Federated Group. I truly appreciated our conversation and learning more about the role and your team.

As a token of my appreciation and to demonstrate my capabilities with EDI systems and IBM Sterling B2B Integrator, I've prepared a comprehensive EDI processing application that I'd like to share with you.

This portfolio piece includes:
- Complete EDI processing application (X12 & EDIFACT support)
- IBM Sterling B2B Integrator integration (file system & API)
- Power BI dashboard generator with pass/fail metrics
- Comprehensive documentation and deployment guides
- Production-ready code with error handling and monitoring

The application is ready to use and includes sample data for immediate testing. All documentation is included in the package.

I'm excited about the possibility of bringing this level of technical expertise and hands-on leadership to Federated Group. I look forward to continuing our conversation.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
