Dear [Name],

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the IT Director position at Federated Group. I appreciated learning more about your technology initiatives and the challenges you're facing.

As we discussed [specific topic from interview - e.g., "EDI processing" or "IBM Sterling integration"], I've prepared a comprehensive portfolio piece that demonstrates my approach to [relevant area]. This application includes:

• IBM Sterling B2B Integrator integration (file system & API)
• EDI processing for X12 and EDIFACT standards
• Power BI dashboard generation
• Acumatica ERP/CRM integration
• Complete IT leadership framework

The package is production-ready with full documentation, deployment scripts, and includes Federated Group branding. I thought this might be useful as you evaluate candidates.

I'm excited about the possibility of bringing this level of technical expertise and strategic leadership to Federated Group. I look forward to continuing our conversation.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. The package is attached as sterling_edi_app.zip. Start with EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md for a quick overview.
