# GitHub Repository Description

## Important: Update Repository Description

If you haven't already, update your GitHub repository description to remove any implied affiliation.

```

**Option 2 (Shorter):**

```

**Option 3 (More Generic):**

```

### How to Update

1. Go to: https://github.com/prendleman/sterling-edi-app
2. Click the gear icon (⚙️) next to "About" section
3. Update the description field
4. Click "Save"

### What NOT to Use

❌ "IBM Sterling EDI Application - Portfolio demonstration for Federated Group IT Director position"
❌ "for Federated Group"

❌ Anything that implies insider build or commissioning

### Why This Matters

The repository description appears prominently on GitHub and can be seen by anyone. Using generic, accurate language prevents any appearance of implied affiliation or commissioned work.
