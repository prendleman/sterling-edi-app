- **Power BI Dashboard**: Automated dashboard generation with pass/fail metrics
- **Production-Ready**: Logging, error handling, monitoring, and deployment scripts

## What's Included

- Complete Python application with full source code
- Detailed deployment documentation
- Power BI dashboard generator
- Sample EDI files for testing
- Windows and Linux deployment scripts

## Quick Start

1. Extract the ZIP file
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. See `QUICK_START.md` for immediate testing

This application demonstrates my understanding of:
